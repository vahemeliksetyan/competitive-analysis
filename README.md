# Armenian mobile operators — competitive analysis (2021–2025)

Quarterly financial and operating indicators of Armenia's three mobile operators —
**Viva**, **Ucom** and **Team** (Telecom Armenia) — extracted from their official reports
into one comparable, English-labelled dataset.

Every operator files the same quarterly report form (approved by the Public Services
Regulatory Commission of Armenia, decision N274Ա of 1 June 2011): revenues by service,
operating expenses, OIBDA, profit before tax, capex, subscribers, ARPU, traffic and more.
The reports are 3-page Armenian PDFs with slightly different layouts and wording per
operator. This project turns 60 of them (3 operators × 20 quarters, 2021 Q1 – 2025 Q4)
into a single table.

## 2025 at a glance

Operating revenues, billion AMD:

| Operator | 2025 | vs 2024 |
|---|---:|---:|
| Viva | 58.03 | +5.1% |
| Ucom | 21.34 | +6.0% |
| Team | 20.92 | +5.6% |
| **Total** | **100.29** | **+5.4%** |

## Output

[`data/final/final.xlsx`](data/final/final.xlsx) — one row per indicator × operator × quarter
(about 4,100 rows). Main columns:

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `company` | Viva / Ucom / Team |
| `Տերեթիվ`, `year`, `quarter` | Quarter start date, year, quarter number |
| `Ինդեքս` | Line number in the report form (e.g. `1.1.3`) |
| `Values` / `Ցուցանիշ` | Indicator name in English / Armenian |
| `Main value` | Section the indicator belongs to (e.g. *Operating revenues*) |
| `Արժեք` | The reported number |
| `Measurement unit` | e.g. *thousand AMD*, *subscribers*, *AMD* |

Amounts are in **thousand AMD**, exactly as reported — nothing is corrected or restated.
The last rows add employee and branch counts (2025 Q4), collected by hand from the
operators' websites ([`data/external/`](data/external/)).

## Data quality

Every value in the final file is checked against the text of its source PDF
([`src/validate.py`](src/validate.py)): all 3,553 reported values are found in the PDFs.
The same step flags spikes, level shifts and broken identities in the operators' own
reports — see [`data/final/anomaly_report.md`](data/final/anomaly_report.md).

Known problems **in the source reports** are listed in
[`docs/source_data_issues.md`](docs/source_data_issues.md). The most important:

- **Team, 2025 Q2 and Q4 — profit before tax and Q4 capex look wrong** (depreciation
  entered with the wrong sign). Use these values with care.
- **Ucom counts broadband in active subscribers**, unlike Viva and Team, so subscriber
  counts and ARPU are not directly comparable.

## How it works

```
data/raw/<operator>/*.pdf
  1. Extract    pdfplumber (default) or Camelot      → data/processed/
  2. Combine    one file per operator                 → data/final/intermediate/
  3. Unify      map each operator's wording to one label   (mappings/unification.xlsx)
  4. Translate  Armenian → English                          (mappings/translation.xlsx, units.xlsx)
  5. Assemble   + employee & branch counts            → data/final/final.xlsx
  6. Validate   check against the PDFs                → data/final/validation_report.xlsx
```

All paths and settings are in [`config.py`](config.py).

## Run it

Python 3.10+.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run_pipeline.py                      # full run with pdfplumber
python run_pipeline.py --operator ucom      # re-extract one operator only
python run_pipeline.py --extractor both     # also run Camelot and compare the two
```

To add a quarter, drop the PDF into `data/raw/<operator>/` as `<Operator>_q<N>_<YYYY>.pdf`
(e.g. `Viva_q1_2026.pdf`) and run the pipeline again.

## Repository layout

```
config.py              paths and settings
run_pipeline.py        runs steps 1–6
src/extraction/        one extractor per operator + shared PDF table parser
src/                   combine, unify, translate, assemble, validate, compare
mappings/              label unification and translation tables (editable in Excel)
data/raw/              source PDFs
data/external/         hand-collected employee and branch counts
data/final/            final dataset, validation report, anomaly report
docs/                  source data issues
